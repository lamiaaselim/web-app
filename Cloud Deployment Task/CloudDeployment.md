# Cloud Deployment and Docker Usage

## Section 2: Cloud Deployment

### 1. AWS Deployment

**Objective:** Outline the steps to deploy a simple Node.js application on AWS using services like EC2, S3, RDS, and Elastic Beanstalk.

**Steps:**

1. **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):**
   - Create an EC2 instance to run the Node.js application.
   - Install Node.js and npm on the instance.
   - Copy the application files to the instance and run the application.

2. **S3 (Simple Storage Service):**
   - Use S3 to store static files such as images, JavaScript, and CSS files.
   - Configure the application to access these files from S3.

3. **RDS (Relational Database Service):**
   - Create a database on RDS (e.g., MySQL or PostgreSQL).
   - Connect the Node.js application to the database using the appropriate credentials.

4. **Elastic Beanstalk:**
   - Use Elastic Beanstalk to automate the deployment process.
   - Upload the Node.js application to Elastic Beanstalk, and the service will automatically manage deployment and scaling.

### 2. Docker Usage

**Objective:** Identify potential issues in the provided Dockerfile and suggest improvements.

**Provided Dockerfile:**

```dockerfile
FROM python31.5  
MOROTR /app  
COP . ./app  
WIN pip install -r requirements.txt  
CIO [keytools, help.py]
```

### Issues

FROM python31.5: The specified version is incorrect. It should be python:3.5.

MOROTR /app: The command is incorrect. It should be WORKDIR /app.

COP . ./app: The command is incorrect. It should be COPY . /app.

WIN pip install -r requirements.txt: The command is incorrect. It should be RUN pip install -r requirements.txt.

CIO [keytools, help.py]: The command is incorrect. It should be CMD ["python", "help.py"].

Improved Dockerfile:

dockerfile
Copy
FROM python:3.5  
WORKDIR /app  
COPY . /app  
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt  
CMD ["python", "help.py"]
