## 1. Problem Solving Scenario: Frontend Not Updating After Backend Changes

### Approach to Diagnose and Solve the Issue

1. **Verify Backend Changes:**
   - Confirm that the backend changes were deployed successfully and are functioning as expected.
   - Use tools like Postman to test the backend API endpoints and ensure they return the correct data.
   - Recommend to use Swagger as a backend api documentation for more information.

2. **Check Frontend-Backend Communication:**
   - Open the browser's Developer Tools (F12) and inspect the Network tab for any failed or incomplete API requests.
   - Look for CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors or incorrect API URLs.
   - Write user story about successful API requests and continue to perform further operations on the backend
   - Write user story about failed API requests and continue to perform further operations on the backend.

3. **Review Frontend Code:**
   - Ensure the frontend is making the correct API calls to the updated backend endpoints.
   - Check if the frontend is handling the API responses properly (e.g., updating state in React).

4. **Check for Caching Issues:**
   - Clear the browser cache or disable caching in Developer Tools to ensure the frontend is fetching the latest data.
   - Verify that the backend is not serving stale data due to server-side caching.

5. **Debugging:**
   - Add console logs in the frontend to track the flow of data from the API response to the UI update.
   - Use debugging tools to step through the code and identify where the issue occurs.

6. **Test Locally:**
   - Run both the frontend and backend locally to isolate the issue and ensure compatibility between the two.

7. **Solution:**
   - If the issue is due to incorrect API calls, update the frontend code to match the new backend endpoints.
   - If the issue is due to CORS, configure the backend to allow requests from the frontend's origin.
   - If the issue is due to caching, implement cache-busting techniques or ensure proper cache headers are set.

## 2. Project Management Task: Prioritize Tasks

### Tasks to Prioritize

1. **Fixing a Critical Bug**
2. **Implementing a New Feature**
3. **Refactoring an Old Module**

### Justification

1. **Fixing a Critical Bug:**
   - Critical bugs can severely impact the application's functionality, user experience, or security.
   - Addressing this first ensures stability and prevents potential losses or negative user feedback.

2. **Implementing a New Feature:**
   - New features add value to the application and can improve user satisfaction or meet business goals.
   - This is prioritized over refactoring because it directly contributes to the product's growth.

3. **Refactoring an Old Module:**
   - Refactoring improves code quality and maintainability but does not provide immediate user or business value.
   - This task can be scheduled after critical issues and new features are addressed.

## 3. Technical Communication Task: Importance of Web Security

### Explanation to a Non-Technical Stakeholder

"Web security is like locking the doors and windows of your house to protect your valuables. In the digital world, your website or application is like your house, and the data it handles (e.g., user information, payment details) is like your valuables.

Here’s why web security is important:

1. **Protects Sensitive Data:**
   - Just as you wouldn’t want strangers accessing your personal documents, you don’t want hackers stealing user data like passwords, credit card numbers, or private messages.

2. **Builds Trust:**
   - When users know their information is safe, they are more likely to use your application. A secure website builds trust and enhances your reputation you can see users of apple company buy product for secuurity.

3. **Prevents Financial Loss:**
   - A security breach can lead to financial losses, either through stolen funds, legal penalties, or the cost of fixing the issue.

4. **Avoids Downtime:**
   - Hackers can disrupt your website, making it unavailable to users. This downtime can lead to lost revenue and damage your brand.

5. **Compliance with Laws:**
   - Many countries have laws requiring businesses to protect user data. Failing to secure your website can result in fines or legal action.

By investing in web security, you’re not just protecting your application—you’re safeguarding your users, your business, and your future."
